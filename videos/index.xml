      <description>Olivine crystal from 1932 eruption of Quizapu Volcano in Chile.   These images were produced using x-ray computed tomography to demonstrate the three dimensional structure and inclusions of volcanic crystals the size of sand grains. Volcanologists use these crystals to study magma movement prior to eruptions. The crystals and magma glass trapped inside them, known as melt inclusions, offer windows into the magma&amp;rsquo;s chemical history. The crystal&amp;rsquo;s chemistry teaches us about the temperature of the magma when it grew.</description>
