I am currently a PhD student working at Columbia University’s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory. My previous background is as a microscopy and computed tomography specialist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.

My research interests focus on using crystal chemistry to decipher earth’s tectonic and volcanic history.
